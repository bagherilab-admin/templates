# Templates

This repository contains templates for Github issues to help manage individual meetings, quarterly reports, and code repos.
In order to use these in a repo:

1. Create a folder `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` at the top level of the repo.
2. Copy the markdown (md) template file into the folder.
Note that the heading is important for Github to recognize the file as an issue template.
3. When you go to create a new issue, your template option should appear.

Feel free to update or modify the templates to match your prefered workflow!
